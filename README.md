### Cradle PHP

Cradle is an unopinionated, minimalist meta framework built around event pipes. Cradle is a different approach to developing applications in PHP. It is not bound to any specific ORM or template engine, you are free to use any you like. Cradle was built for PHP7 in mind.

See [https://cradlephp.github.io/](https://cradlephp.github.io/) for more information.
